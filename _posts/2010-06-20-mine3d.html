<div class="bold">
  3-dimensional version of the original Minesweeper
</div>

<div>
  Mine3D was created during my university studies as a programming beginners project using <a href="http://www.openframeworks.cc/">OpenFrameworks</a>. As a true Minesweeper fan, I was curious if a 3D version would be fun to play. It works surprisingly well, but the game itself is quite complex. As a solution to this I introduced 'sweep' mode, where it is possible to delete mines instead of marking.

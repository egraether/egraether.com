<div class="bold">
  round version of the classic 2-player Pong
</div>

  This game was created as exercise for my studies. It can be played in double or single, against the computer. If the ball touches the border, the player who touched the ball at last, gets the point. The project hasn't been completed yet. The ball still behaves weird in some cases and the interface lacks some buttons. But it's quite funny to play, so give it a try!

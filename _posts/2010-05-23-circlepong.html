    round version of the classic 2-player Pong
  </div>

  This game was created as exercise for my studies. It can be played in double, by 2 players, or single, against the computer. The one who touched the ball at last, gets the point. The project is sadly not finished so far, ball behaves weird sometimes and the interface lacks some buttons. But it's quiet funny to play, so give it a try!

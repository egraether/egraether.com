    depth and stencil experiment in WebGL
</div>

<div>
This experiment demonstrates boolean operations on convex meshes. There are two types of meshes, a cube and a sphere. With a click you can switch between the operations intersection and substraction. The combination of the meshes also changes at every second click. I used <a href="http://code.google.com/p/glmatrix/source/browse/glMatrix.js">glMatrix.js</a> for matrix and vector calculations.

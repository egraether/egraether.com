    3-dimensional version of the original Minesweeper
  </div>

  Mine3D was created during my university studies as a programming beginners project using <a href="http://www.openframeworks.cc/">OpenFrameworks</a>. I hopefully came up with the expectations of real Minesweeper fans, allthough there are minor features missing. The simple binary space partition and the trackball interface work pretty fine, but the game itself is quite complex.

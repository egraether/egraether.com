  3-dimensional version of the original Minesweeper
</div>

<div class="projectText">
  This game was created during my university studies using <a href="http://www.openframeworks.cc/">OpenFrameworks</a> and is a programming-beginners-project. There are some features missing and problems on some systems, but I hopefully came up with the expectations of real Minesweeper fans.

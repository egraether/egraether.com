<div class="bold">
    simple soft body physics simulation in WebGL
</div>

<div>
This demo was an exercise for the Realtime Simulation course of my studies. You can build soft bodies out of cubes and let them fall on the ground afterwards. Originally new cubes could only be added per entering their position. Now the mouse-position is unprojected and cubes can be added per click. In wireframe-mode you can see all springs that generate the simulation. Again, I used <a href="http://code.google.com/p/glmatrix/source/browse/glMatrix.js">glMatrix.js</a> as math library.

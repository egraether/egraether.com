        particle shading experiment in WebGL
    </div>

I developed this small experiment for measuring the difference in performance between two methods of luminance and alpha shading. Both methods use the same vertex-shader, but different fragment-shaders. The first uses a texture with mipmapping, the second determines luminance and alpha through distance calculations. I have not noticed any difference regarding the performance.
